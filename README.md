# README for #FOSSConf23 Keynote Tech Talk by Jatin K Malik
All the sample code used for tech talk "Elevate Your Code // Practical Insights for 10X Impact" in [FOSSConf New Delhi 2023](https://web.archive.org/web/20231111195115/https://conference.fosscu.org/). 

This talk, presented by [@jatinkrmalik](https://twitter.com/jatinkrmalik), is designed to enhance your coding skills and provide practical insights into various aspects of software development. The focus was on Python, but the concepts are largely language agnostic.

## Using the Slide Deck
The slide deck for this talk is available in markdown format [here](0_SLIDE_DECK/SLIDES.md) and can be presented using the [mdp](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp) CLI tool in the terminal. 

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have `mdp` installed on your system. If not, you can install it using package managers like `apt` or `brew`:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install mdp # For Debian/Ubuntu

$ brew install mdp # For macOS
```

### Running the Presentation
1. Navigate to the root directory of this repository.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   $ mdp 0_SLIDE_DECK/SLIDES.md
   ```
3. Navigate through the slides using arrow keys.

### Adjusting Terminal Settings for Optimal Viewing
- You may adjust the font size and colors of your terminal for a better viewing experience. 
- This can usually be done in the terminal settings/preferences.
